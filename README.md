Bootstrap bindings to use with Eliom/Ocsigen

- http://getbootstrap.com/
- http://ocsigen.org/

This project aim at building a coherent set of helpers and binding to 
ease the use of Bootstrap together with Eliom

Initial code is from Drup's project :
https://github.com/Drup/evePI/

I splitted it into various .ml files to benefit from Merlin when coding

The plan is to complete it on a "bind a widget when I need it" basis.
Any help would be appreciated.

I'm new to both bootstrap and eliom so any comment or proofread is welcome !
